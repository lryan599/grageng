# simple-graphrag-engine

## intro

This is a simple GraphRAG engine that primarily provides GraphRAG inference services. In particular, it can generate contexts based on existing knowledge graphs, facilitating subsequent answer generation by LLMs.

This repository will reference the code from some open-source projects, such as GraphRAG and LightRAG.

This project is primarily intended for academic research purposes. So do not use it in production.
